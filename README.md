# DankOS
"It's dank and it's an OS"

A simple, real mode, OS just for the heck of it!

# Building instructions
(NASM is required)

It contains a 'make_me.sh' bash script that automatically builds an image
from the bootloader.

It also automatically assembles and copies all ASM files in the 'sources'
directory, and copies (just copy) all files from the 'extra' directory
in the image.
